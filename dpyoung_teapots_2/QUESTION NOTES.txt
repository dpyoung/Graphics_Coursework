teapotAssignment2_Question1.1.cpp
	This file contains question 1.1's work. It displays 6 teapots displayed using
	different orderings of the rotate and translate calls specified. It seems like
	calling these functions out of order positions the teapot in different areas of
	its appropriate screen.
teapotAssignment2_Question1.2.cpp
	This file contains the code for 1.2. This code works like 1.1's code but adds
	myTranslatef and myRotatef functions to replicate the GL versions.
teapotAssignment2_Question2.1.cpp
	This file contains the first of three parts for question 2. It simply displays a
	perpective projection of a teapot.
teapotAssignment2_Question2.2.cpp
	This file contains code for question 2.2, as well as 2.3. The code adds camera 
	controls for pitch, yaw, roll, and slide. Please note that sliding too far 
	distorts the teapot.
teapotAssignment2_Question2.3.cpp
	This file is redundant (see previous file). The code adds camera controls for
	pitch, yaw, roll, and slide. Please note that sliding too far distorts the teapot.


Teapots that follow the rotate-rotate-translate patterns exhibit relatively normal behaviors.
The rest of the teapots, while still resembling teapots, look slightly distorted....
